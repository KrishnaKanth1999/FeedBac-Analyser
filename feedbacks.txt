Put aside Dr. House repeat missed, Desperate Housewives (new) watch one. don't know exactly plagued movie. never thought I'd say this, want 15 minutes fame back.<br /><br />Script, Direction, can't say. recognized stable actors (the usual suspects), thought Herbert Marshall class addition sat good cheesy flick. Boy, wrong. Dullsville.<br /><br />My favorite parts: "office girl" makes 029 keypunch puts cards 087 sorter. LOL @ "the computer". I'd like someone identify next device - 477 ? It's even dinosaur's time.<br /><br />And dinosaurs don't much time waste.
big fan Stephen King's work, film made even greater fan King. Pet Sematary Creed family. moved new house, seem happy. pet cemetery behind house. Creed's new neighbor Jud (played Fred Gwyne) explains burial ground behind pet cemetery. burial ground pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed bury human (or kind pet) burial ground, would come back life. problem, come back, person, they're evil. Soon Jud explains everything Pet Sematary, everything starts go hell. wont explain anymore don't want give away main parts film. acting Pet Sematary pretty good, needed little bit work. story one main parts movie, mainly original gripping. film features lots make-up effects make movie way eerie, frightening. One basic reasons movie sent chills back, fact make-up effects. one character film truly freaky. character "Zelda." particular character pops film three times precise. Zelda Rachel Creed's sister passed away years before, Rachel still haunted her. first time Zelda appears movie isn't generally scary isn't talking anything, second time worst, honest, second time scares living **** me. absolutely nothing wrong movie, almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, pretty good acting, first rate plot, mesmerizing make-up. truly one favorite horror films time. 10 10.
watched horrid thing TV. Needless say one movies watch see much worse get. Frankly, don't know much lower bar go. <br /><br />The characters composed one lame stereo-type another, obvious attempt creating another "Bad News Bears" embarrassing say least.<br /><br />I seen prized turkeys time, reason list since "Numero Uno".<br /><br />Let put way, watched Vanilla Ice movie, bad funny. This...this...is even good.
truly enjoyed film. acting terrific plot. Jeff Combs talent recognized for. part flick would change ending. death creature far gruesome Sci Fi Channel.<br /><br />There interesting religious messages film. Jeff Combs obviously played Messiah figure creature (or shark prefer) represented anti-Chirst. particularly frightening scenes 'end world feel'. noticed third viewing classic creature feature. know many people won't get references Christianity, watch close you'll get it.
memory "The Last Hunt" stuck since saw 1956 13. movie far ahead others time addressed treatment natives, environment, ever present contrast short long term effects greed. relevant today 1956, cinemagraphic discussion utmost depth relevance. top setting beautiful cinematography excellent. memory movie end days.
Shakespeare fan, appreciate Ken Branagh done bring Shakespeare back new generation viewers. However, movie falls short conveying overall intentions play ridiculous musical sequences. Add Alicia Silverstone's stumbling dialogue (reminiscent Keanu Reeves Much Ado Nothing) poorly cast roles, equals excruciating endurance viewing.
privilege watching Scarface big screen beautifully restored 35mm print honor 20th anniversary films release. great see big screen much lost television sets overall largesse project cannot emphasized enough. <br /><br />Scarface remake classic rags riches depths hell story featuring Al Pacino Cuban drug lord Tony Montana. version, Tony comes America Cuban boat people immigration wave late 1970s, early 1980s. Tony cohorts quickly get green cards offing political figure Tent City brief stay Cuban restaurant; Tony launched horrific path towards total destruction. <br /><br />Many characters movie played skilled manner enjoyable watch forgot little film last twenty years. Robert Loggia Tony's patron, Frank Lopez wonderful. character flawed trusting, Tony quickly figures out, soft. Lopez's right hand, Omar Suarez portrayed one greatest actors, F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus.) Suarez ultimate toady anything Frank; like mind own. Tony quickly sees constantly battles Suarez, really sees minor problem get way top. character always comes back played perfectly Mel Bernstein, audaciously corrupt Miami Narcotics detective played Harris Yulin (Training Day.) Mel, without guilt extorts great sums money form sides drug industry. plays Tony Frank catches scene marks exit film Frank Mel. priceless hear Frank asking Mel intercede, Tony kill hear Mel reply, `It's tree Frank, you're sitting it.' man Frank paying protection!<br /><br />Tony's rise meteoric matched speed intensity quick crash burn. offing Frank taking wife business Tony's greed takes never seem get enough. Tony plunges deeper world drugs, greed inability trust eventually kills best friend sister fallen love married. sets ending Tony's compound stormed army supplier feels betrayed Tony would go political assassination ordered. stems form compassionate moment Tony refused accomplice murder would involved victim's wife children.<br /><br />All great depiction 1980s excess cocaine culture. DePalma nice job holding together one fastest moving three hour movies around. violence extremely graphic contains scenes forever etched viewers mind, particularly gruesome chainsaw seen, two point blank shots head entire bloody melee ends movie. highly recommended stylistically done film squeamish, need upbeat endings potential sequels; DePalma let fly right here.
real classic. shipload sailors trying get towns daughters fathers go extremes deter sailors attempts. maidens cry aid results dispatch "Rape Squad". cult film waiting happen!

many problems film, worst continuity; re-editing VHS college cable channel many years ago, tried figure exactly went wrong. seems happened actually constructed much longer film chopped standard theatrical viewing. much longer? fill holes plot would require three hours narrative character development - especially given fact film slow takes seriously.<br /><br />That's staggering; could Halperins possibly trying accomplish here? previous film, "White Zombie", successful low budget attempt duplicate early Universal Studios monster films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), stuck pretty close zombie mythology North America would know popular magazines.<br /><br />Revolt Zombies, contrary, appears intended allegory politics modern war. would explain opening, change Dean Jagger's character megalomaniac, also explains zombies don't actually much film, besides stand around, look frightening, wait orders - they're allegorical soldiers, undead cannibals we've come love loathe zombie films.<br /><br />I equal dislike modern war politics - think film ought entertaining first, later, maybe, educational. definitely - film zombies ought zombies.<br /><br />Truly one bizarre films Hollywood history, one recommend, even historic value.
Rosie wasted lot TV time talking Tainos super influential dynamics modern day Puerto Rican. not. truth Africans Spanish knows it. kills standing screen looking like average light skin black chick ( obvious black daddy, cousins auntie)pretending truly acknowledge real essence makes modern day Puerto Ricans,but barely mentioned Africans influenced way Spanish spoken, food music. typical lost lot respect support anything else does. Also, since wants dance around African-ness need take roles associated blackness (i.e. Lackawanna Blues). find prideful Black Latina next time (thank Zoe Saldana,Gina Torres, Gina Ravera Melissa DeSousa).<br /><br />To Puerto Rican said African "black"....thank you. "blacks" certainly anything common "you" love lost. But, since probably States benefited Civil Rights movement would like refuse decent human treatment received courtesy blood ,sweat tears backs "blacks" share nothing with.<br /><br />If correct Puerto Ricans terrible image media, blacks spend time trying disrespect know media loves exploits low points behaviors minorities maintain mindless generalizations. However, evidently fed hype one somehow white superior...you not. Also, somehow feel compelled believe black culture BET...again incorrect need take vacation hood. Try visiting Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Trust none blacks want claim "culture" either.
